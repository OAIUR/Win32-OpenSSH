(MSRC)

Yes, you can create a report on Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) to report a security vulnerability you found in a Microsoft product or service. To do this, you'll need to follow these steps:
 * Go to the MSRC website: https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report
 * Sign in to your Microsoft account. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can create one for free.
 * Fill out the report form. The form will ask you for information about the vulnerability, such as the type of vulnerability, the affected product or service, and the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
 * Submit your report. Once you have submitted your report, MSRC will review it and take appropriate action.
Here are some additional tips for creating a security vulnerability report:
 * Be as detailed as possible in your report. The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for MSRC to investigate the vulnerability.
 * Be specific about the steps to reproduce the vulnerability. This will help MSRC to verify the vulnerability and develop a fix.
 * Proofread your report carefully before submitting it.
I hope this helps!
